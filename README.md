# Program

This program is based on https://code.google.com/p/open-3d-viewer/ which is used as the basis for the [Zygote Body Browser](http://zygotebody.com/) (previously called the Google Body Browser). So far very few changes to the code have been made, but there are plans to develop it further.

## Samples

The models provided in web/models are cellular models instead of anatomy examples like the original open-3d-viewer.

## Link

This might work: [https://kreier.github.io/open-3d-viewer/web/](https://kreier.github.io/open-3d-viewer/web/). Not working directly, working on it ...

## Online Version - 2013

You can go to [webgl-tests.crbs.ucsd.edu](http://webgl-tests.crbs.ucsd.edu/)
for an online-usable version of the program (called "Whole Cell Viewer" there).

(Unfortunately in 2022 it no longer works)
